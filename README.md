# Data-Migration_British Library Sound Archive
This power point presentation shows the workflow I designed to migrate data and metadata from the old Sounds.bl.uk website to the new one. At the same time, it indicates all the aspects to take into consideration when approaching a sound migration project.

The new Sonds.bl.uk website makes publicly available copyright-cleared items from the BL Sound Archive's collections. The collections can be divided in 8 curatorial areas: Oral History, Drama and Literature, Spoken English, Radio, Pop Music, Classical Music, World and Traditional Music, Wildlife. <br>
In 2020, migrating all these items from the old and outdated website to a new one became necessary. 


Aims of the Data Migration project:
- migrating all data and metadata available from the old website to the new one
- implementing up to date archival preservation standards during migration
- insure completeness, accuracy and integrity of data and metadata

Challenges:
- integrity of data: items displayed on the old website were extrapolated from single units (i.e. tracks from a single compact casssette, or one side only of a disc)
- completeness of metadata: requirements for the new website included cataloguing fields ignored in the old website (.i.e. durations and genres became mandatory)
- accuracy of metadata: metadata had to be quality checked. Also, they had to align with new structural requirements (i.e. call numbers had to correspond to layout of audiofiles on the physical carrier)
- new preservation standards: the current website adopts the METS schema (a standard test for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata regarding objects within a digital library). The old website did not, since its main aim was to allow access to sound resources, rather than preserving them for the long term. This meant re-thinking completely our way and tools to approach collections' preservation, and making sure that data and metadata were now consistent with this new approach.

Vocabulary:
- SAMI refers, in this presentation, to the cataloguing software (ILS) used by the Sound Archive to host descriptive metadata about sound carriers and recordings. The ILS used by the Sound Archive is SirsiDynix WorkFlows.
- PROD refers to the catalogue entry describing the physical carrier of sound recordings (i.e. compact cassette, disc etc.)
- REC refers to the catalogue entry describing the sound recording itself (i.e. song, oral history interview, radio broadcast etc.)
- SIP tool is an in-house built platform to preserve sound items through the Submission of Information Packages.


The .ppt file available in the main folder has been created in Power Point 365. In order to activate slides' zoom animations, it is recommended that the file be opened with the same version of the software.
